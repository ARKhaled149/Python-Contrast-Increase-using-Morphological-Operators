# Python-Contrast-Increase-using-Morphological-Operators
Use the Equation to increase the contast: ImageNew = ImageOld + ConstantA * ( ImageOld- Opening(ImageOld,ConstantB) ) - ConstantB * (Closing(ImageOld,ConstantB) - ImageOld) <br />
The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 1 and b = 1 <br />
The output image with a square structuring element of size 9 x 9 when a = 1 and b = 1 <br />
The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 5 and b = 1 <br />
The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 1 and b = 5 <br />
Comments on the effect of increase the structuring element size on the output image <br />
Comments on the effect of increasing or decreasing a and b on the output images <br />
Suggestion that could decrease the contrast using morphological operators <br />
