# Python-Contrast-Increase-using-Morphological-Operators
Use the Equation to increase the contast: ImageNew = ImageOld + ConstantA * ( ImageOld- Opening(ImageOld,ConstantB) ) - ConstantB * (Closing(ImageOld,ConstantB) - ImageOld)
•         The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 1 and b = 1.
•         The output image with a square structuring element of size 9 x 9 when a = 1 and b = 1.
•         The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 5 and b = 1.
•         The output image with a square structuring element of size 3 x 3 when a = 1 and b = 5.
•         Comments on the effect of increase the structuring element size on the output image.
•         Comments on the effect of increasing or decreasing a and b on the output image.
•         Suggestion that could decrease the contrast using morphological operators.
