1. opening in the expression extracts the bright embeddings/features meaning high valued pixels,
   closing extracts the dark ones, so, the addition of the bright and subtraction of the dark,
   results in increasing the contrast and brightening the image with of course playing around
   the a and b.

2. Increasing the SE allowed more pixels to be part of the oprening and closing;
   as for the dilation part, 3x number of pixels were allowed as for the closing but
   they didn't cancel each other because they are not the complement of each other.

3. increasing a increased the contrast and brighted the image while maintaining the main 
   feature of the increasing itself which is more edges were detected clearly,
   increasing b only increased the edge detection.

4. lower the value of a could result in decreasing the contrast or we could change the signs of the
   expression, that would focus more on the dark embeddings therefore decreasing the contrast.
